# Terraforming Mars Strategy Guide (Codex)
## Version: 2026-02-15 / 01

This guide is a practical playbook for winning Terraforming Mars.
It includes:
- complete game flow and scoring fundamentals,
- advanced strategy frameworks,
- concrete updates from the 2026-02-15 loss (Codex 72 vs John 104).

## 1. Win Condition and Scoring

### Game end
The game ends when all three global parameters are maxed:
1. Temperature at +8C.
2. Oxygen at 14%.
3. Oceans at 9.

### Final VP sources
1. Terraform Rating (TR).
2. Milestones.
3. Awards.
4. Greenery tiles.
5. City adjacency.
6. VP on cards (including negative VP cards).

Core truth:
- You do not win by "having a good engine."
- You win by converting resources and tempo into VP before the game ends.

## 2. Setup and Round Structure

### Setup basics
1. Choose a corporation.
2. Take starting resources from corporation.
3. Draw initial project cards and buy wanted cards at 3 MC each.
4. Resolve prelude setup if Prelude is enabled.
5. Start Generation 1.

### Generation phases
1. First player marker passes.
2. Research phase: draw 4, buy any at 3 MC each.
3. Action phase: players alternate actions until all pass.
4. Production phase: energy -> heat, then gain resources by production tracks.

### Typical actions
1. Play a project card.
2. Use a blue card action.
3. Standard project.
4. Convert 8 plants to greenery.
5. Convert 8 heat to temperature.
6. Claim milestone.
7. Fund award.
8. Pass.

Final greenery reminder:
- After global completion and final production, players still place final greeneries from plants.

## 3. Card Types and Requirements

### Card types
1. Green: permanent passive effects.
2. Blue: persistent cards, often with actions/triggers.
3. Red: one-time events.

### Requirements
Cards can require:
1. Global states (temp/oxygen/oceans).
2. Tag counts.
3. Resource or production preconditions.

Rule discipline:
- Always check if a "good card" is a "good card now."
- Timing beats raw card quality.

---

## 4. Resource Model and Practical Value

### Resources
1. MC: universal and most flexible.
2. Steel: building cards only.
3. Titanium: space cards only.
4. Plants: 8 -> greenery.
5. Energy: converts to heat in production.
6. Heat: 8 -> temperature.

### Practical valuation guidelines
1. MC is highest flexibility, especially late.
2. Steel/titanium are efficient only if hand supports conversion.
3. Plants are high leverage for oxygen/TR/board VP.
4. Heat is reliable TR but less explosive than greenery in many endgames.

Critical anti-waste principle:
- Unconverted steel/titanium/MC near game end is often hidden VP loss.

---

## 5. Board Play Fundamentals

### Tile scoring logic
1. Greenery: 1 VP to owner.
2. City: 1 VP per adjacent greenery, any owner.
3. Oceans: no direct VP but huge tempo and adjacency value.

### Strategic board principles
1. City networks multiply VP.
2. Greenery placement is both scoring and denial.
3. Ocean adjacency MC enables tempo spikes.
4. Good city timing is often worth more than one extra production card.

Board diagnosis from last game:
- We had 0 city VP.
- Opponent had 13 city VP.
- That category alone created a decisive gap.

---

## 6. Milestones and Awards Discipline

### Milestones
Milestones are cheap, high-certainty VP.
Plan your claim path by Generation 3 to 4.

### Awards
Funding an award is not "tempo."
Funding is a contract to hold first place at endgame.

Award lock rule:
1. Fund only if first place is durable.
2. Avoid funding volatile categories unless denial is urgent.
3. Re-evaluate each funded award every generation.

Lesson from 2026-02-15:
- Funding `Thermalist` without durable lock gave opponent a 5 VP swing.

---

## 7. Standard Projects: Use Cases

Standard projects are expensive but strategically essential.

Use them when:
1. You need guaranteed global progress now.
2. You need specific tile placement now.
3. You need immediate VP conversion in late game.
4. Your hand is weak but closure timing is critical.

Do not dismiss standard projects in endgame.
Unused MC is often worse than a standard greenery or city.

---

## 8. Draft and Card Buy Framework

### Draft priorities
1. Your best synergy cards.
2. Opponent denial cards.
3. Flexible conversion cards.

### Buy discipline
Each bought card costs 3 MC before play.
Overbuying slows tempo.

Keep cards when they are:
1. playable soon,
2. strategically aligned,
3. better than MC alternatives.

Sell/punt cards when:
1. they are too late,
2. they do not fit your path,
3. they block immediate conversion.

But do not sell direct TR/VP cards in final window if you can play them.

---

## 9. Macro Strategy: Rush vs Engine

Two valid archetypes:
1. Terraform rush (shorten game).
2. Engine scale (lengthen game, out-convert late).

### Early rush assessment checklist (Gen 1 to 3)
Go rush-leaning if at least two are true:
1. You have efficient temp/ocean pushes.
2. Opponent has obvious slow setup cards.
3. You can contest at least one milestone early.
4. You can keep one stable VP lane while rushing.

Go engine-leaning if:
1. Opponent is pushing globals faster than you.
2. You have strong card draw/discount loops.
3. You have clear late VP multipliers and survival time.

---

## 10. Rush 2.0 (Updated from Latest Game)

Big update:
- Rush cannot be "pure globals only."
- Rush needs a VP floor plus denial layer.

### Rush transition trigger
At first maxed global parameter, switch from pure rush to 3-lane play:
1. Closure lane: finish remaining global(s).
2. VP floor lane: secure city/card VP baseline.
3. Denial lane: prevent opponent award/milestone/city spikes.

### Why this update exists
In the 2026-02-15 game:
1. We won TR by 24.
2. We still lost by 32 total VP.
3. Opponent won via card VP + city VP + public points.

Conclusion:
- Tempo alone is insufficient against high-conversion engines.

---

## 11. Phase-by-Phase Playbook

### Early game (Gen 1 to 3)
1. Build production that converts within expected game length.
2. Establish milestone direction.
3. Avoid dead VP cards.
4. Build map anchors for future city/greenery value.

### Mid game (Gen 4 to 7)
1. Convert engine into scoreable position.
2. Track award races every generation.
3. Start closure math on globals.
4. Avoid funding awards without lock confidence.

### Late game (Gen 8+)
1. Shift from setup to immediate VP.
2. Count actions remaining, not just resources.
3. Spend MC on board points before final pass.
4. Convert plants/heat aggressively.
5. Protect against last-turn opponent city/animal spikes.

---

## 12. Endgame Conversion Protocol

When game is likely ending within 1 to 2 generations:
1. Stop speculative production buys.
2. Prioritize direct VP/TR cards.
3. Use standard projects for guaranteed board VP when needed.
4. Never pass with high-MC conversion available unless forced.
5. Convert all plants/heat.
6. Re-check funded awards before each pass.

Final-turn checklist:
1. Any direct TR card playable?
2. Any city with positive adjacency EV?
3. Any greenery placement that is net favorable?
4. Any award standing can flip this turn?
5. Any resource will die unconverted?

---

## 13. Opponent Model: How to Beat a Blue-Style Engine

If opponent shows plant/science/animal scaling:
1. Assume they can win without TR lead.
2. Deny oxygen control where possible.
3. Disrupt award categories they target.
4. Force game end before their card VP stack matures.
5. Keep your own city/card VP floor above zero.

A rush win condition vs this profile:
1. Fast global close.
2. One milestone.
3. One reliable award.
4. At least moderate city or card VP floor.

Missing item 4 is usually fatal.

---

## 14. Common Failure Modes

1. Funding awards as tempo instead of lock.
2. Overcommitting to TR while ignoring score floor.
3. Ending with stranded steel/titanium.
4. Selling late direct-VP/TR cards.
5. Passing with MC that could become board VP.
6. Not tracking oxygen as final bottleneck in plant-heavy games.

---

## 15. Practical Decision Heuristics

1. Every generation ask: "How do I gain VP this turn?"
2. If a production gain will not break even before end, skip it.
3. If an award is fundable but not lockable, delay or avoid.
4. If one global is maxed, start VP floor building immediately.
5. If opponent has strong card VP lane, accelerate end and deny board multipliers.

---

## 16. Compact Table Heuristic (Use During Play)

At start of each action round:
1. Count remaining global steps.
2. Estimate generations left.
3. Compare VP lanes:
- TR,
- milestones/awards,
- city/greenery,
- card VP.
4. Choose one primary lane and one backup lane for this generation.
5. Re-evaluate after each opponent action.

---

## 17. Final Summary

Winning Terraforming Mars requires three things together:
1. Tempo control.
2. Conversion discipline.
3. Public point control.

From the latest game:
- Rush read was correct.
- Rush execution failed because VP floor and denial were underbuilt.

Use this updated doctrine:
- Rush early if correct,
- transition at first maxed global,
- finish with immediate VP conversion and award lock discipline.
