# Terraforming Mars Gameplay Strategy Guide

This guide is a practical, decision-oriented reference for playing Terraforming Mars well.
It includes:
- Core rules and flow so the game is playable from this document.
- Advanced strategy and decision frameworks for consistent wins.
- Specific lessons learned from the 2026-02-14 match (Codex 75 vs John 127).

## 1. Objective and Core Scoring

In Terraforming Mars, you are a corporation trying to maximize final Victory Points (VP).

Primary VP sources:
- Terraform Rating (TR): each TR is 1 VP.
- Milestones: fixed VP for claims.
- Awards: VP based on final ranking in funded awards.
- Board: greenery tiles, plus city adjacency points.
- Card VP text: many played cards grant or subtract VP.

Win condition:
- The game ends when all three global parameters are maxed.
- Temperature to +8C.
- Oxygen to 14%.
- Oceans to 9 tiles.

Important:
- Ending the game is strategic. If you are ahead on point-conversion categories, accelerate the end.
- If you are behind and have stronger long-term scaling, slow it down if possible.

## 1A. Setup and Rules Quickstart

Use this mini-setup when learning or bootstrapping an agent:

- Each player selects a corporation from dealt options.
- Each player gets starting resources from that corporation.
- Each player draws initial project cards and buys desired cards at 3 MC each.
- Optional modules (Prelude, Colonies, Turmoil, etc.) alter setup and strategy priorities.
- Place initial first-player marker and begin Generation 1.

Card categories:
- Green cards: permanent effects once played.
- Blue cards: ongoing cards with repeatable actions or triggers.
- Red cards: one-time event effects.

Tags and requirements:
- Cards have tags (building, space, science, plant, etc.) used for synergies and prerequisites.
- Some cards have global requirements (temperature, oxygen, oceans) that must be met.
- Some cards require spending or reducing resources/production as part of play.

Action legality basics:
- You can only perform actions currently available to your corporation and board state.
- You cannot spend resources you do not have.
- Production can go down from attacks/effects; track this carefully in award races.

Scoring and tiebreak basics:
- End scoring combines TR, milestones, awards, board VP, and card VP.
- Negative VP cards subtract from total.
- If tied, remaining MC is standard tiebreak in most tables.

## 2. Generation Flow (How a Round Works)

Each generation has four phases:

1. Player Order
- First player marker passes.

2. Research
- Draw 4 cards.
- Buy any you keep for 3 MC each.

3. Action Phase
- Players alternate turns taking 1 or 2 actions.
- Common actions include:
- Play a project card.
- Use a blue card action.
- Convert 8 plants to greenery.
- Convert 8 heat to temperature.
- Use a standard project.
- Claim a milestone.
- Fund an award.
- Pass.

4. Production
- Energy converts to heat.
- Gain resources by production tracks.
- MC gain = TR + MC production.

Final greenery conversion:
- After game-end trigger and final production, players still place final greeneries from plants.
- Do not forget this; it changes final board VP.

## 3. Resource System and Practical Value

Resources:
- MegaCredits (MC): universal currency.
- Steel: pays for building-tag card costs at steel value.
- Titanium: pays for space-tag card costs at titanium value.
- Plants: 8 -> 1 greenery.
- Energy: converts to heat each production.
- Heat: 8 -> 1 temperature raise.

Practical valuation guidelines (non-absolute):
- MC is always flexible and strongest late-game.
- Steel/titanium are strong when your hand supports them; otherwise they can become trapped value.
- Plants are high leverage because greenery gives both board VP and oxygen/TR.
- Heat is reliable TR, but less explosive than greenery in many endgames.

## 4. Board Rules That Matter Strategically

Tile types:
- Greenery.
- City.
- Ocean.
- Special tiles from cards.

Board scoring:
- Each greenery tile is 1 VP to owner.
- Each city scores 1 VP per adjacent greenery (any owner).

Placement consequences:
- City placement is not just immediate economy; it is a long-term VP anchor.
- Greenery placement is both your score and potentially your opponent's if next to their cities.
- Ocean adjacency cash and placement bonuses can swing tempo.

Advanced board principle:
- Board multipliers (city + greenery adjacency networks) often decide games more than raw engine size.

## 5. Milestones and Awards

Milestones:
- Claimed once each, race-based, highly efficient VP.
- Usually under-contested by weaker players and over-contested by strong players.

Awards:
- Must be funded during the game, scored at end.
- Funding cost escalates by order funded.
- Funder does not automatically win the award.

Critical discipline:
- Do not fund awards you cannot realistically hold.
- Treat each funded award as a commitment to lock first place by game end.

## 6. Standard Projects and When to Use Them

Standard projects are expensive but always available.
They are not "bad"; they are tactical tools.

Use standard projects when:
- You need to close the game now.
- You need exact board placement now.
- You need guaranteed terraforming now.
- Your hand is weak but tempo is critical.

Do not overuse standard projects early unless:
- They unlock immediate bonus chains.
- They claim/deny milestones.
- They secure a decisive board position.

## 7. Drafting and Card Buy Discipline

Drafting is where expert edge begins.

Draft priorities:
- Cards that fit your current engine.
- Cards that deny opponent's engine spikes.
- Cards that align with your likely endgame scoring path.

Buying discipline:
- Each card kept costs 3 MC before play cost.
- Overbuying cards kills early tempo.
- If a card cannot be played in useful timing, it is often a liability.

Practical rule:
- Keep hand lean and intentional; avoid speculative hoarding without a clear conversion path.

## 8. Strategic Archetypes

There are two macro archetypes:
- Terraforming rush: maximize global parameter pushes and end quickly.
- Engine scaling: build production and card velocity, then out-convert late.

Good play is adaptive, not ideological.

Terraforming rush works best when:
- You are ahead on TR and board.
- Opponents are in setup mode.
- You can deny their scaling turns.

Engine scaling works best when:
- You can secure safe growth turns.
- You have strong draw/discount loops.
- You can still pivot to direct VP before end.

## 9. Game-Phase Strategy Framework

Early game (Gen 1-3):
- Build income and flexible production.
- Avoid dead VP cards unless they are exceptionally efficient.
- Establish probable milestone lanes.

Mid game (Gen 4-7):
- Convert engine to practical position:
- Milestones.
- Board anchors (cities/greenery scaffolding).
- Award threshold tracking.
- Keep one eye on remaining global steps.

Late game (Gen 8+):
- Shift from production to points.
- Count remaining generations every round.
- Convert all resources aggressively.
- Prioritize guaranteed VP over future-value setup.

## 10. Player-Count Adjustments

2-player:
- Longer games on average.
- Engine scaling and card draw increase in value.
- Board has more space; timing contests are narrower.

3-player:
- Balanced environment.
- Both rush and engine plans viable.
- Pivot timing becomes the key skill.

4-5 player:
- Faster parameter completion.
- Tempo, milestones, and tactical board denial increase in value.
- Slow engines are punished if they do not pivot early.

## 11. Advanced Tactical Patterns

1. Single-action stalling
- Taking one action can preserve optionality and force opponent reveals.

2. Two-action bursts
- Taking two actions can secure irreversible tactical sequences.

3. Threshold sniping
- Watch parameter bonus steps and act to capture the benefit, not just advance the track.

4. Denial drafting
- Remove opponent's highest-leverage synergy cards even when not perfect for you.

5. Endgame forcing
- If ahead, prioritize actions that reduce remaining global steps quickly.

6. Resource liquidation planning
- In final generations, cards in hand are often MC reservoirs via sell patents.
- Plan this one generation ahead, not at the last second.

## 12. Lessons Learned From the 2026-02-14 Match

Match result:
- Codex 75.
- John 127.
- Delta: 52 VP.

Observed deciding gaps:
- City VP gap: very large (John far ahead).
- Awards: Codex funded 3 awards; John won all 3.
- TR gap favored John.
- Greenery and card VP also favored John.
- Codex carried negative VP burden.

What this means strategically:
- Engine quality alone does not win if board and award conversion are lost.
- Award funding without durable threshold control is a major risk.
- Late-game production plays without near-term VP payback are often too slow.
- City/greenery network value must be planned earlier, not improvised at end.

Corrective principles extracted:
- Do not fund multiple awards unless you can defend first-place thresholds.
- Start endgame VP conversion earlier (usually by Gen 8-9 in faster tables).
- Prefer immediate point conversion over incremental production in final rounds.
- Preserve enough liquidity to contest board and awards without forced card liquidation.
- Track city adjacency value every greenery placement.

## 13. Endgame Conversion Checklist

Before each late-generation turn, ask:
- How many global steps remain?
- How many turns remain realistically?
- Can I gain more VP by ending now or extending?
- Which action gives the highest guaranteed VP this turn?
- Which resources must be converted before game end?

Priority order in final rounds (general):
1. Secure/deny decisive milestone or award outcomes.
2. Convert plants to highest-value greenery positions.
3. Place/enable cities only if adjacency payoff is real and immediate.
4. Convert heat if temperature not maxed.
5. Play only cards that score now or materially flip scoring races.
6. Sell dead cards to fund direct VP actions.

## 14. Common High-Level Mistakes

- Building an engine past the point where it can repay.
- Funding awards emotionally instead of mathematically.
- Ignoring board multipliers from city adjacency.
- Overvaluing card quantity over card timing.
- Ending with unconverted plants/heat.
- Playing for "good value" instead of "highest current VP swing."

## 15. Operating Guide for an Agent Player

Use this decision loop each action phase:

1. Snapshot score lanes:
- TR trend.
- Milestones.
- Awards.
- Board VP potential.
- Card VP trajectory.

2. Classify table tempo:
- Fast-closing or slow-scaling.

3. Choose stance for this generation:
- Accelerate end.
- Maintain.
- Extend for engine payoff.

4. Allocate resources accordingly:
- If accelerating, buy immediate points and parameter pushes.
- If extending, strengthen only high-payback engines.

5. Re-evaluate after every opponent action:
- Update races and adjust.

## 15A. Opponent-Modeling Tasks (Required Every Game)

These are mandatory tasks, not optional heuristics.

At the start of each generation (from Gen 3 onward), record a quick opponent forecast:
- Projected final TR.
- Projected final card VP.
- Projected final city VP.
- Projected final greenery VP.
- Expected milestone split.
- Expected award split.

Then update your own forecast in the same lanes and compute where you are behind.

Per action, rank candidate plays with this priority score:
- `Immediate VP gained + VP denied to opponent + end-timer control value`.

Never choose a lower-priority action unless it is required for legality sequencing.

## 15B. Hard Decision Gates (Use Exact Triggers)

1. Milestone gate (by Gen 4):
- For each live milestone, explicitly choose `contest` or `concede`.
- Do not stay in an ambiguous middle line.

2. Opponent VP ceiling gate (by Gen 6):
- If opponent projected `card_vp >= 35`, or projected `(card_vp + city_vp) >= 45`,
  then stop pure tempo play.
- Switch immediately to one of:
- Fast-close line (force remaining globals down quickly), or
- Mirror VP line (city/card VP engine with immediate payoff).

3. Award funding gate:
- Fund an award only if first-place hold is durable under reasonable opponent lines.
- If lock is not durable, convert the same action/economy into direct VP or denial.

4. Endgame protocol gate (Gen 10+ or when all globals are within ~3 steps):
- Before first action, write a concrete 3-action finish plan.
- Recompute after each opponent action.
- Prefer guaranteed VP swing over setup value.

## 16. Final Strategic Principle

Terraforming Mars is won by converting resources into final-score categories earlier and more efficiently than opponents.
The best player is not the one with the prettiest engine.
The best player is the one who ends the game when their point-conversion profile is strongest.

## 17. Post-Game Learning Loop (Required)

Every finished game should update the shared learning dataset.

Core files:
- `agent-prompts/codex_from_gameplay/postmortem-template.md`
- `agent-prompts/codex_from_gameplay/game-summary-template.json`
- `agent-prompts/codex_from_gameplay/decision-taxonomy.md`
- `agent-prompts/codex_from_gameplay/game-learning-dataset.jsonl`
- `agent-prompts/codex_from_gameplay/game-learning-rollup.md`
- `scripts/tm_learning.py`

Workflow:
1. Write a full postmortem using the template.
2. Fill one summary JSON record for the game.
3. Append it to the dataset:
- `python3 scripts/tm_learning.py append --summary <summary-path>`
4. Review the updated rollup and add 1-3 actionable rule updates.

Minimum quality bar per game record:
- Include complete score breakdown fields.
- Tag mistakes with taxonomy labels.
- Include counterfactuals with VP swing estimates.
- Include concrete rule updates that can be applied in the next game.
