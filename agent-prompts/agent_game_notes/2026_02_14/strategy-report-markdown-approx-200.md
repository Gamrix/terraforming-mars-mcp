# Terraforming Mars Match Report
## Codex vs John
**Scope:**
- Strategic comparison for the completed game.
- Why John won.
- Evidence from final game-state totals and phase-level choices.
**Final Result:**
- **John (Blue): 127 VP**
- **Codex (Red): 75 VP**
- **Margin: +52 VP for John**
---
## 1. Executive Summary

John won because he converted economy into points faster and more reliably in the last third of the game.
Codex built a robust engine and secured one milestone, but the conversion from engine value to scoring value lagged.
The largest practical gaps were city scoring, award outcomes, and Terraform Rating.
The final generation confirms this pattern: Codex still made engine-adjacent plays while John closed with direct point categories.
Codex also funded all three active awards, but John captured first place in each at scoring.
That single strategic inversion produced a high-leverage swing.

## 3. Strategic Identities
### Codex Strategy Profile
- Corporation: **Inventrix**.
- Core identity: discount engine + flexible requirements + infrastructure density.
- Key infrastructure cards included Earth Catapult, Mass Converter, Research Outpost, AI Central.
- Tag profile leaned heavily to buildings and science.
- Attempted to pressure award races by funding Scientist, Banker, Miner.
- Tactical disruption lines appeared late (Predators, production attacks, award contests).
- Board conversion into city adjacency value was limited.
### John Strategy Profile
- Corporation: **Teractor**.
- Core identity: broad economy with strong Earth discount stack and smooth cash conversion.
- Built a mixed scoring surface: TR growth, milestones, city network, award thresholds, card VP.
- Transitioned from setup to scoring mode earlier.
- Preserved flexibility and avoided self-inflicted negative VP.
- Consistently translated generation income into final scoring categories.
---
## 4. Milestones and Awards
### Milestones
- Codex claimed **Builder**.
- John claimed **Terraformer** and **Gardener**.
- Milestone edge: **+5 VP John**.
### Awards
- Codex funded **Scientist**, **Banker**, **Miner**.
- John won first place in all three by final scoring.
- Award edge: **+15 VP John**.
### Why This Matters
Funding awards can be strong when threshold control is stable.
In this game, funding happened before durable lock-in.
John used the funded pools as high-value targets and took all three.
This transformed Codex’s investment into John’s scoring gain.
---
## 5. Board and Spatial Conversion
### Board Totals
- Occupied spaces at end: 37.
- Codex cities: 2.
- John cities: 5.
### Board VP Effects
- Codex city VP: 3.
- John city VP: 20.
- City VP edge: **+17 VP John**.
- Codex greenery VP: 7.
- John greenery VP: 12.
- Greenery edge: **+5 VP John**.
### Interpretation
John’s city network converted tile placement into high-multiplier scoring.
Codex gained greenery and some tempo tiles, but lacked comparable adjacency extraction.
On Tharsis, that city-adjacency multiplier often defines endgame; it did here.
---
## 6. Economy and Conversion Efficiency
### End Production
- Codex MC production: 27.
- John MC production: 35.
- End MC-prod delta: **+8 for John**.
- Codex steel/titanium production: 3/3.
- John steel/titanium production: 1/1.
### Practical Effect
Codex had stronger metal specialization.
John had stronger universal liquidity.
Late game rewards universal liquidity because options narrow to direct points and board finishes.
Codex’s specialized economy needed specific card windows that were not always available.
John’s cash-heavy profile supported cleaner point conversion each turn.
---
## 7. Card-Level Scoring Character
### Codex
- Positive card VP existed and was meaningful.
- But Codex carried **-5 negative VP** total.
- Some late plays increased engine quality more than final scoring yield.
- Generation 11 included resource-constrained decisions and patent selling.
### John
- Card VP total reached 18.
- No negative VP drag.
- Animal growth and multiple direct VP cards remained active in the final stretch.
- Endgame deck usage tilted toward closure, not setup.
### Net Insight
Card quality was not the issue for Codex.
**Timing of conversion** was the issue.
John shifted into conversion mode earlier and stayed there.
---
## 8. Timing and Phase Transition
### Early Game
- Both players built viable engines.
- Codex developed discount and draw infrastructure quickly.
- John developed economy depth with Earth and science support.
### Mid Game
- Codex pursued balanced growth and award setup.
- John widened MC throughput and began stronger board leverage.
- Milestone race started favoring John due to Terraformer/Gardener pathing.
### Late Game
- John converted economic lead into points across several categories at once.
- Codex had to defend multiple fronts simultaneously.
- Multi-front defense reduced ability to spike one decisive category.
- Late tactical wins by Codex changed margins but not control structure.

## 9. Why John Won (Direct Causal Chain)
1. John built a stronger cash conversion engine.
2. John secured two milestones to Codex’s one.
3. Codex funded awards that John later won.
4. John outperformed heavily in city scoring.
5. John also led in TR and greenery.
6. John avoided negative VP penalties.
7. John’s final-generation actions stayed scoring-focused.
8. Codex’s final turns still included partial engine maintenance behavior.
This chain explains both the winner and the size of the margin.
---
## 10. Most Decisive Numeric Drivers
- **City VP:** +17 John.
- **Awards VP:** +15 John.
- **TR:** +7 John.
- **Greenery VP:** +5 John.
- **Milestones VP:** +5 John.
- **Negative VP differential:** +5 John.
Even before card VP details, this stack already explains the bulk of the final gap.
---
## 11. Codex Strengths That Still Showed
- Strong engine architecture and discount layering.
- Good tactical awareness in award contests.
- Effective disruption attempts (including animal pressure and production pressure).
- Solid card flow management via action cards.
- Builder milestone claim and consistent board presence.
These strengths prevented an even larger blowout.
They did not, however, overturn John’s superior conversion profile.
---
## 12. What Needed to Change for Codex to Win
- Delay or reduce award funding unless first-place lock probability is high.
- Reallocate late-generation resources from infrastructure to direct VP lines.
- Prioritize city-adjacency board multiplication earlier.
- Minimize negative VP acceptance unless immediate swing is decisive.
- Avoid late patent liquidation that reduces endgame optionality.
- Convert discount engine into points sooner, especially by Generation 9-10.
If two of these pivots happen earlier, the final margin likely compresses significantly.
If three happen, the winner could plausibly flip in a similar draw environment.
---
## 13. Final Verdict
John did not win from a single combo.
John won by **category control plus timing discipline**.
He led more scoring buckets, converted cash better, and captured the awards Codex paid to open.
Codex’s strategy was coherent and technically strong, but too much value stayed in engine form for too long.
At final scoring, John’s value was already in points, while Codex still had unrealized potential.
That is the core strategic reason for **127 to 75**.

## Appendix A: One-Line Diagnosis
John won because he reached a stronger late-game state earlier and then spent every remaining action on high-certainty point conversion.
## Appendix B: Scoring Identity Comparison
- Codex: infrastructure-forward, discount-rich, tactical contest play.
- John: economy-forward, city-and-award conversion, early closure posture.
## Appendix C: Practical Lesson for Next Match
When you fund multiple awards, treat each as a contract to hold first place by endgame, not as a tempo statement.
## Appendix D: 20 Practical Takeaways
- 1) Secure award thresholds before funding multiple awards.
- 2) In Gen 9+, prefer direct VP over infrastructure unless payoff is immediate.
- 3) City adjacency usually outscales isolated greenery plans.
- 4) Cash flexibility outperforms metal specialization in final turns.
- 5) Track award races every generation, not only near endgame.
- 6) Treat negative VP cards as debt requiring explicit repayment plans.
- 7) Do not overvalue card draw after conversion windows close.
- 8) Preserve at least one high-value scoring pivot for Gen 11.
- 9) If behind on board VP, force slower end timing when possible.
- 10) If ahead on board VP, accelerate end conditions aggressively.
- 11) Banker races punish delayed MC-production pivots.
- 12) Scientist races demand counting future tags, not current ties.
- 13) Miner races can flip late; do not assume temporary leads hold.
- 14) Patent selling is acceptable, but it signals prior liquidity misalignment.
- 15) Discount engines are only as good as the cards left to convert.
- 16) Tactical disruption helps margins but rarely replaces structural scoring.
- 17) Milestones are cheapest VP when claimed on tempo.
- 18) Multi-front comebacks require one dominant scoring lane commitment.
- 19) Endgame planning should begin no later than Generation 8.
- 20) The winner usually converts uncertainty to guaranteed VP first.
