# Card Strength Analysis (Game: Codex vs John, 2026-02-14)

This review ranks my **card purchases** in that finished game from best to worst by realized in-game value.

Notes:
- I used the **effective play costs shown in-game** (`calculatedCost`), which already included discounts.
- This is not a generic tier list. It is a **postmortem for this specific match state**.
- Corp/prelude cards are excluded from ranking since they are setup picks, not normal project purchases.

## Top 10 Purchases

### 1) Earth Catapult (effective cost 23)
Earth Catapult was the highest-leverage purchase in the game because it improved the economics of almost every later card play. The effective impact was cumulative: even medium cards became acceptable when the discount was already baked into their play flow. It also contributed positive VP directly and helped me maintain tempo during midgame turns where MC was tight. In this run, it was the closest thing I had to a true scaling engine piece.

### 2) Satellites (effective cost 10)
Satellites produced a major MC production jump at exactly the phase where my board already had enough space tags to convert it into immediate value. That timing mattered more than raw card text: it created a bridge from “I can play one good card” to “I can chain multiple scoring/tempo plays.” It also supported my late standard-project pressure by improving per-generation liquidity. Relative to cost, this was one of my best economy spikes.

### 3) Media Archives (effective cost 8)
Media Archives was a highly efficient burst-economy purchase in this specific game because event density was already substantial by the time it was played. The card effectively converted existing game history into immediate spending power without waiting for future generations. That immediate cash injection enabled downstream city/greenery and tempo decisions. For 8 cost, its realized impact was very high.

### 4) Io Mining Industries (effective cost 41)
Despite being expensive, Io Mining Industries delivered because it aligned with my titanium and space trajectory. It contributed a large chunk of endgame card VP (3 VP) while also improving long-run spending quality through titanium production. The high upfront cost was painful, but in this game it still paid back through multi-generation utility and scoring. It was one of the few heavy cards that actually justified its slot.

### 5) Insects (effective cost 9)
Insects was a strong conversion card once oxygen hit the requirement and my greenery plan was active. The plant production boost translated directly into either TR/VP through greenery or pressure on endgame pace. It fit my pivot to board scoring better than many cards in hand at that point. This was a good mid-late pickup with clean synergy.

### 6) Rad-Chem Factory (effective cost 8)
Rad-Chem Factory was a clean late-game TR conversion purchase: cheap enough to fit the turn, immediate enough to matter, and not dependent on multi-gen scaling. The energy production hit was manageable in my state, while +2 TR was guaranteed value in a close endgame race. In a game where I needed direct scoreboard movement, this card did exactly what was needed. High certainty and low execution risk made it strong.

### 7) Ganymede Colony (effective cost 20)
Ganymede Colony provided a solid VP anchor (+3 VP) and useful city-tag structure for my broader city plan. It did not create explosive tempo, but it did provide stable endgame points that held value regardless of the board fight. In this match, reliable VP cards were important because my award race was weak. It was a good “bankable points” purchase.

### 8) Lava Tube Settlement (effective cost 15)
Lava Tube Settlement gave me a key city placement at a decent cost point and supported both board presence and final city adjacency potential. The tile itself was not enough to win the city race, but it materially improved my local scoring cluster. Compared to standard-project city pricing, this was an efficient way to add city structure while still playing from hand. It was a meaningful board-value purchase.

### 9) Ice Asteroid (effective cost 23)
Ice Asteroid contributed to ocean progression and board tempo in a phase where global parameter movement still mattered for strategic control. Even though oceans were eventually maxed, this card helped me convert resources into terraforming progress and board bonuses earlier. It was not as swingy as my top economy cards, but it was still above replacement in this match. Good utility value with acceptable cost.

### 10) Power Infrastructure (effective cost 4)
Power Infrastructure was a low-cost utility purchase that repeatedly smoothed awkward turns by converting spare energy into MC. It prevented resource waste in multiple generations and enabled better action sequencing (especially when no strong project card line existed). The per-use ceiling was low, but the flexibility was consistently helpful. For 4 cost, it overperformed.

## Bottom 10 Purchases

### 1) Anti-Gravity Technology (effective cost in hand 12, unplayed)
This was the weakest purchase in realized terms because it stayed dead in hand and never met its science requirement. I paid research cost for a card that delivered zero board impact and zero scoring. In a game where tempo and closure mattered, holding this card represented opportunity loss. This was a clear overbuy.

### 2) Physics Complex (effective cost in hand 10, unplayed)
Physics Complex also remained unplayed and unproductive, making it a direct economic drag. Its value profile requires sustained energy surplus and multiple turns of activation, which never aligned with my game state. I effectively spent for optionality that did not materialize. Another strict ROI miss.

### 3) Birds (effective cost in hand 8, unplayed)
Birds was purchased but not converted into points, partly due timing and partly due endgame action friction. Even ignoring the input mismatch incident, it arrived too late to reliably generate meaningful animal VP. It also risked reducing my own plant production in a greenery-sensitive finish. In this run, it was a poor late buy.

### 4) Corporate Stronghold (effective cost 11)
Corporate Stronghold imposed heavy negative VP pressure (-2 VP) in a game where I was already trailing the high-end scoring race. While it provided a city and production utility, the scoreboard tax was hard to justify in this specific matchup. I did not extract enough adjacency value to compensate. Net result was below expectations.

### 5) Biomass Combustors (effective cost 4)
Biomass Combustors was cheap but had weak realized impact and included a negative VP component in final scoring. The production disruption on opponent plants was not decisive, and the energy gain did not translate into enough downstream value. In a point-tight late phase, this card was mostly noise. Low cost, but still poor conversion.

### 6) Flooding (effective cost 7)
Flooding delivered some board utility but also carried negative VP and did not produce a decisive tempo swing in this game. The ocean tempo it offered was less valuable by the time global parameters accelerated under opponent pressure. I paid for a mixed-effect card without strong leverage. Net value ended up mediocre-to-poor.

### 7) Indentured Workers (effective cost 0)
Even at low upfront cost, Indentured Workers contributed negative VP and did not create enough compensating efficiency in this match. In principle it can be a tempo tool, but here the scoreboard penalty persisted while the tempo gain was diffuse. In a game lost heavily on total VP, this kind of marginal negative card hurt. It underperformed relative to alternatives.

### 8) Insulation (effective cost 2)
Insulation was inexpensive but low-impact, and in this game it did not materially change my production quality or scoring trajectory. The opportunity cost was small, but so was the upside. It is the kind of card that is acceptable only when curve-fitting a specific line; I did not have that line here. Overall, weak value density.

### 9) Lichen (effective cost 7)
Lichen was not catastrophic, but it was slower than what the game pace ultimately rewarded. I needed stronger immediate conversion into TR/VP or stronger denial tools, and this was more incremental than decisive. The plant production pathway was already contested and tempo-sensitive. Relative to what I could have bought, this was a soft miss.

### 10) Cartel (effective cost 8)
Cartel had moderate value on paper but did not convert into enough real score/economic edge in this particular run. It neither accelerated my closeout plan nor blocked opponent scaling meaningfully. In hindsight, this slot would have been better as a tighter VP or denial card. It was not terrible, but it was among the lowest-return plays in this match.

## Summary Lessons From These Rankings

1. I did well when I bought cards with immediate conversion (`Satellites`, `Media Archives`, `Rad-Chem Factory`) or compounding universal discounts (`Earth Catapult`).
2. I lost value by buying speculative late cards that needed more turns (`Anti-Gravity Technology`, `Physics Complex`, `Birds`).
3. Negative-VP utility cards must be held to a much stricter standard in games where I am behind on awards and card VP.
4. Next game, I should tighten late-draft rules: if a card cannot credibly score or swing tempo before end, skip it.
