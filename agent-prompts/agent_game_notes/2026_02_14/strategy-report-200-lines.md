001. Terraforming Mars Match Report: Strategic Comparison and Win Analysis.
002. This report explains what strategy each player used and why John won.
003. Final score: John 127, Codex 75.
004. Final score gap: 52 points.
005. The game ended in Generation 11 with all three core globals completed.
006. Temperature reached 8C, oxygen reached 14%, and oceans reached 9.
007. Both players used engine-building plans, but John converted engine value to points better.
008. Codex pursued a mixed economy and tempo pressure strategy.
009. John pursued a high-economy, city-and-award conversion strategy.
010. The match hinged on point conversion, not only production growth.
011. Codex corporation was Inventrix.
012. John corporation was Teractor.
013. Teractor created strong Earth-tag economic discounts for John.
014. Inventrix gave Codex requirement flexibility but not direct economy.
015. Codex leaned into discounts via Earth Catapult, Mass Converter, and Research Outpost.
016. John leaned into stacked Earth discounts via Teractor and Earth Office.
017. Codex had high building tag density: 17 building tags.
018. John had broader economic tag spread with 10 Earth tags and 10 science tags.
019. Codex focused on infrastructure-heavy tableau development.
020. John focused on cash throughput plus scoring surfaces.
021. Codex claimed Builder milestone for 5 VP.
022. John claimed Terraformer and Gardener milestones for 10 VP total.
023. Milestone delta already favored John by 5 VP.
024. Codex funded Scientist, Banker, and Miner awards.
025. John won all three funded awards at scoring.
026. Award swing against Codex was huge.
027. John earned 15 award VP from Codex-funded awards.
028. Codex earned 0 award VP from those same awards.
029. Net award swing was 15 points immediately.
030. Funding awards early without lock control became a strategic liability for Codex.
031. Codex TR ended at 45.
032. John TR ended at 52.
033. TR alone gave John +7 over Codex.
034. Codex greenery score was 7 VP.
035. John greenery score was 12 VP.
036. Greenery difference added another +5 for John.
037. Codex city score was 3 VP.
038. John city score was 20 VP.
039. City placement and adjacency was the largest board-scoring gap.
040. John gained +17 over Codex from city scoring alone.
041. John ended with 5 cities versus Codex at 2 cities.
042. John also benefited from denser greenery adjacency to his cities.
043. Codex had meaningful card VP value at 15 VP from cards.
044. John had 18 VP from card text scoring.
045. John still beat Codex in card VP despite Codex’s science-heavy engine.
046. Codex carried -5 negative VP from cards.
047. John had no negative VP penalty.
048. Negative VP discipline mattered in a close endgame race.
049. Codex negative VP sources included Corporate Stronghold, Nuclear Zone, and Energy Tapping.
050. John avoided comparable negative VP liabilities.
051. Codex built a strong discount stack and played many medium-value projects.
052. John built a stronger cash engine and converted it into endgame points.
053. Codex ended with MC production 27.
054. John ended with MC production 35.
055. The +8 MC production gap multiplied across late generations.
056. John’s late-game liquidity enabled flexible scoring choices.
057. Codex often had to sell patents to fund immediate plays.
058. Selling patents traded optionality for short-term tempo.
059. That lowered Codex’s late conversion ceiling.
060. John preserved more payoff cards to the finish.
061. Codex used AI Central and Inventors’ Guild for card flow.
062. John used Development Center and Business Network for card flow.
063. Both players drew well, but John converted cards to points more effectively.
064. Codex’s tableau had many support effects and discounts.
065. John’s tableau had more direct point and conversion cards.
066. John leveraged Fish for recurring animal VP growth.
067. Codex answered with Predators to reduce Fish momentum.
068. The Predators interaction helped but arrived too late to close the full gap.
069. Codex played Herbivores and did gain animal VP.
070. John still maintained stronger aggregate board and award scoring.
071. Codex attempted late Miner control with Asteroid Mining Consortium and Great Escarpment Consortium.
072. Those plays temporarily improved Miner race position.
073. John ultimately retook Miner at final scoring.
074. Miner final was John 8 to Codex 7.
075. Scientist final was John 10 to Codex 9.
076. Banker final was John 35 to Codex 27.
077. Banker margin was the biggest award margin.
078. John’s economy architecture directly targeted Banker win conditions.
079. Codex funded Banker without securing a durable banker lead.
080. That decision amplified downside.
081. Codex tried to contest Banker via Toll Station and Food Factory.
082. Those moves narrowed, but did not maintain, the lead.
083. John’s late production and card effects widened banker value again.
084. John’s board strategy was more point-dense.
085. Codex placed useful tiles but with lower adjacency payoff.
086. John’s city network extracted higher marginal VP from each greenery.
087. Codex had respectable greenery count but weak city monetization.
088. John’s city-centric finish compounded in final scoring.
089. Codex’s strategy prioritized engine stability over aggressive point conversion.
090. John shifted from engine build to point harvesting earlier.
091. Timing difference in strategy phase change was decisive.
092. Codex spent resources to improve future production in late generations.
093. John spent more resources on direct or near-direct VP in late generations.
094. In Generation 11, Codex still played setup-adjacent cards like Industrial Microbes.
095. Industrial Microbes improved production but had limited remaining turns to pay back.
096. John used late actions to maximize final score categories.
097. Codex also sold many cards in Generation 11 to finance immediate plays.
098. That was correct tactically but indicates strategic cash stress.
099. John did not show comparable liquidation pressure.
100. Financial freedom translated into stronger final turns.
101. Codex succeeded at global parameter pressure and helped finish the game.
102. Fast finish can be good when ahead on points.
103. Here, fast finish favored John because John already led major scoring buckets.
104. Codex needed either faster award lock or stronger board-point catch-up before ending.
105. Ending conditions arrived with John ahead in TR, city VP, greenery VP, and awards.
106. Codex’s best buckets were card VP depth and building infrastructure.
107. Those buckets were not enough to offset board and award deficits.
108. John had stronger total board control in scoring regions.
109. Codex had good tactical disruption but not enough strategic denial.
110. Examples include targeted production hits and Predators steal.
111. Those interventions reduced margin but did not reverse outcomes.
112. John’s Earth package produced sustained MC advantage.
113. Cards like Cartel, Sponsors, and Earth discount effects reinforced the loop.
114. John’s science package also enabled flexibility and efficient sequencing.
115. Anti-Gravity Technology added broad cost pressure relief.
116. Shuttles and other discounts reduced space-card costs at key times.
117. Codex also had excellent discount infrastructure.
118. But Codex discount power often fed into medium-efficiency plays.
119. John converted discounts into higher scoring density.
120. That conversion efficiency is central to why John won.
121. John’s VP by generation accelerated sharply: 87, 111, then 127.
122. Codex’s VP by generation climbed steadily but slower: 64, 73, then 75.
123. The late-game slope difference is the clearest quantitative signal.
124. Codex’s final generation produced only modest additional VP.
125. John’s final generations delivered explosive VP accumulation.
126. John’s ending card set had several direct VP cards.
127. Examples include Anti-Gravity Technology, Phobos Space Haven, Immigration Shuttles, and Fish growth.
128. Codex card VP package was solid but included penalties.
129. Codex also carried more non-scoring utility cards at game end.
130. Utility cards lose value once there are no future generations.
131. John’s end-state minimized dead value.
132. Codex’s end-state retained some unrealized utility potential.
133. Production comparison at end also favored John for monetary throughput.
134. Codex: 27 MC prod, 3 steel prod, 3 titanium prod.
135. John: 35 MC prod, 1 steel prod, 1 titanium prod.
136. John relied less on metal specialization and more on pure cash flexibility.
137. Cash flexibility is safer in the final two generations.
138. Codex metal-heavy lines needed specific card opportunities.
139. John’s generalized liquidity better supported standard and hybrid scoring lines.
140. Codex attempted late Nuclear Zone for TR and board tempo.
141. Nuclear Zone contributed tempo but also imposed negative VP.
142. John avoided equivalent self-penalizing score events.
143. Codex successfully reached 45 TR, which is respectable.
144. John reached 52 TR, creating a strong baseline lead.
145. Baseline lead reduced John’s risk when contesting awards.
146. John could accept short-term inefficiency while preserving score lead.
147. Codex had to chase multiple deficits simultaneously.
148. Chasing Banker, Scientist, Miner, and board points at once diluted focus.
149. John only needed to defend leads and improve where cheap.
150. Defensive leadership is easier than multi-front comeback play.
151. Codex did execute several strong tactical turns.
152. The Fuel Factory into Asteroid Mining Consortium line was good.
153. Great Escarpment Consortium was also a strong contest move.
154. Space Elevator was a strong long-term value project.
155. The issue was strategic timing relative to remaining generations.
156. High-payback infrastructure arrived when immediate VP was more urgent.
157. John’s strategy was more generation-aware in the endgame.
158. John shifted to point conversion earlier and harder.
159. Codex stayed in engine-improvement mode slightly too long.
160. That delayed direct scoring pressure.
161. Another difference was city leverage.
162. John repeatedly transformed greenery and placements into city adjacency points.
163. Codex could not mirror that board multiplier.
164. Board multiplier is often the largest swing on Tharsis endgames.
165. This game followed that pattern exactly.
166. Award funding sequence also impacted psychology and tempo.
167. Codex funding all three created urgency but also exposed downside.
168. John could focus on beating thresholds rather than funding costs.
169. John effectively converted Codex’s funding investment into his own points.
170. That is a major strategic reversal.
171. In summary, John won because he dominated point conversion categories.
172. Those categories were TR, milestones, awards, greenery, and especially city VP.
173. Codex won Builder and built a robust engine, but that was insufficient.
174. The engine produced resources, not enough final points.
175. John’s strategy produced points directly and repeatedly.
176. John also avoided negative VP traps.
177. Codex accepted several negative VP cards for tactical reasons.
178. Tactical gains did not fully repay those penalties at final scoring.
179. John’s win was not from one combo but from cumulative category control.
180. Category control created resilience against Codex tactical counterplays.
181. Even when Codex contested Miner and Scientist, John recovered late.
182. Even when Codex pressured economy, John kept Banker lead.
183. Even when Codex stole animals, John still held superior board + city value.
184. Therefore the match outcome was structurally stable by late Generation 10.
185. Generation 11 actions changed margins, not winner identity.
186. If Codex wanted a different outcome, key pivots were earlier.
187. Earlier pivots include delaying award funding until secure thresholds.
188. Another pivot is earlier city-and-greenery adjacency build.
189. A third pivot is reducing late-generation infrastructure spend.
190. A fourth pivot is preserving card flexibility to avoid mass patent sells.
191. A fifth pivot is converting discount engine into higher immediate VP cards sooner.
192. John’s execution matched those priorities better in this game.
193. The final 127-75 score reflects repeated small edges, not a single blunder.
194. Codex played a coherent engine game with strong tactical moments.
195. John played a higher-conversion scoring game with stronger category coverage.
196. That strategic profile is why John won decisively.
197. End-state evidence supports this conclusion across every major scoring bucket.
198. The largest hard evidence items are city VP gap, award sweep, and TR lead.
199. The secondary evidence items are greenery lead and no negative VP penalties.
200. Final conclusion: John won by superior endgame point conversion and category control.
