## General Repo Information

- The main goal of the repo is to create an MCP server that can interact with the
Terraforming Mars Open Source Server, allowing agents to play the game by calling the MCP server's HTTP API.
- A copy of the server that hosts the game is found at `submodules/ts-oss-server/`.
